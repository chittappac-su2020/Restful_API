# What is REST?

- REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
- Used to transfer data around.
- It is an alternative to traditional web pages.
- RESTful APIs are Stateless Backends

# RESTful Constraints

- Client-Server architecture (RESTful API should not care about the UI)
- Stateless (No Client context is stored on the server)
- Cacheability (Responses must define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable)
- Layered System (Intermediate Servers maybe used without the Client knowing about it)
- Uniform Interface (Resources are identified in Requests, transferred data is decoupled from db schema)
- Code on Demand (Executable Code could be transferred) (Optional)
